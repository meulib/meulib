	<b>Concern: People Do Not Return Books</b><br/><br/>
	Here are some points to consider:
	<ul>
		<li>Explicitly ask for the books back, then people mostly <b>do</b>  return. Do not wait too long to ask for a return. Suggested lending duration is: 3 weeks.
		<li>When you lend a book, make sure you record it on Meulib. This 
			will help you keep track. Against each of your books Meulib tells you how many days have passed since you recorded lending it.
		<li>Start with lending some books you are willing to take a bit 
			of chance with.
		<li>If you do not want to lend a book to someone you can always
			decline the request.		
		<!-- li>Meulib will send automatic emails asking borrowers to return. This feature is to be developed.
		<li>Meulib shall have a provision to give feedback on borrowers and lenders. If you see a borrower with a negative feedback from
			some other Meulib owner, you can choose to not lend to that
			person. This feature is to be developed. -->
	</ul>
	Please note: Meulib is not responsible if a book does not come back to you.

	<b>Concern: People Mutilate Books</b><br/><br/>
	Here are some points to consider:
	<ul>
		<li>Start with lending some books you are willing to take a bit 
			of chance with.
		<li>If you do not want to lend a book to someone you can always
			decline the request.		
		<!-- li>Meulib shall have a provision to give feedback on borrowers and lenders. If you see a borrower with a negative feedback from
			some other Meulib owner, you can choose to not lend to that
			person. This feature is to be developed. -->
	</ul>
	Please note: Meulib is not responsible if your book gets mutilated.<p>
	<b>Fixing a time and place to meet? That is too complex. Who has the time to do this?</b><br/><br/>
	You need not go anywhere to lend your book. You can ask the borrower to come and take it from you, at your home or office or anyplace else that you frequent.<br/>
	<br/>
	There are so many people we meet everyday and live within easy reach of.
	People in our building, in our neighborhood, at office ... They do not know of our collection. Letting them know of what we are willing 
	to lend, itself is a huge contribution to a public library by me and you.
	<p>
	
	<b>I am in X city. How do I borrow a book from You in Y city?</b><br/><br/>
	While Meulib hopes to spread all over the country
	and the globe, it has been envisaged that borrowing and
	lending will happen mostly locally, within towns, within localities of metropolises. However, it is totally upto the owner and the lender. If you come across a book in another town / city / country and the owner is willing to lend it to you or give it to you, very good! If the owner wants to be paid for shipment (or the book itself), that too is up to the borrower and owner.<p>
	
	<b>Can I get requests from strangers? It may not be safe to meet a stranger.</b><br/><br/>
	Yes, it is possible to receive requests from strangers. In such a situation, you have the following options:<br/><br/>
	1. If you are not comfortable, decline the request.<br/>
	2. Communicate further with the person and ask to know more about the person before deciding whether you want to meet him / her.<br/>
	3. If you do decide to meet the person, please do take necessary practical steps of precaution as per your living environment.<br/><br/>
	Please note: Meulib is not responsible for the behavior or actions of any member.<p>

	<b>Is there any franchisee fees or royalty to be paid to Meulib for lending my books?</b><br/><br/>
	No, you do not need to pay Meulib for lending your books.<!-- Going forward, Meulib may have some additional paid features. However, to lend your books for free to people, there are no charges.--><p>
