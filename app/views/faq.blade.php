	<b>People Do Not Return Books</b><br/><br/>
	Here are some points to consider:
	<ul>
		<li>Explicitly ask for the books back, then people mostly <b>do</b> mostly return. Do not wait too long to ask for a return. Suggested lending duration: 3 weeks.
		<li>When you lend a book, make sure you record it on Meulib. This 
			will help you keep track.
		<li>Start with lending some books you are willing to take a bit 
			of chance with.
		<li>If you do not want to lend a book to someone you can always
			decline the request.		
		<li>Meulib will send automatic emails asking borrowers to return. This feature is to be developed.
		<li>Meulib shall have a provision to give feedback on borrowers and lenders. If you see a borrower with a negative feedback from
			some other Meulib owner, you can choose to not lend to that
			person. This feature is to be developed.
		<li>Meulib is not responsible if a book does not come back to you.

	<b>Fixing a time and place to meet? That is too complex. Who has the time to do this?</b><br/><br/>
	You need not go anywhere to lend your book. You can ask the borrower to come and take it from you, at your home or office or anyplace else that you frequent.<br/>
	<br/>
	There are so many people we meet everyday and live within easy reach of.
	People in our building, in our neighborhood, at office ... They do not know of our collection. Letting them know of what we are willing 
	to lend, itself is a huge contribution to a public library by me and you.
	<p>
	<b>I am in X city. How do I borrow a book from You in Y city?</b><br/><br/>
	While Meulib hopes to spread all over the country
	and the globe, it has been envisaged that borrowing and
	lending will happen mostly locally, within towns, within localities of metropolises. However, it is totally upto the owner and the lender. If you come across a book in another town / city / country and the owner is willing to lend it to you or give it to you, very good! If the owner wants to be paid for shipment (or the book itself), that too is up to the borrower and owner.<p>
	<b>Meeting strangers in today's world - it is so unsafe.</b><br/><br/>
	Ok ... well let lend to and borrow from our friends, family, acquaintainces. That itself would be a tremendous actualization of a public library by me 
	and you.<br/><br/>
	If we lend to strangers too, great! We hope you will, and there by make new friends in person. After all, seeing a person read a book we like is like the book recommending the person!<br/><br/>
	However, please exercise the normal pragmatism, as per your own judgement, in interacting with anyone - be it friends, family, acquaintainces or strangers. Meulib is not responsible for the behavior or actions of members.<p>
