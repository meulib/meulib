ourlib
======

Platform for running finely distributed truly public, public libraries. 

The collection of these libraries consist of books owned by the library members themselves. The members offer their books for lending. Other members browse the library collection and contact members via this platform to borrow books. The borrower and lender meet to lend and to return the book. The software helps manage this lending-borrowing transaction between members.

This results in public libraries that have potentially unlimited collections and are free of space and funding constraints.
