Welcome to the Meulib Garden

Hi ...

Welcome to our Meulib Garden of books. Grown by you and me. This a garden of sharing, a garden where ideas comes and sit on your nose and suddenly flitter away. Or their aroma seeps into you and goes and sits right in your belly!

Here are some of the ways to hop skip around our garden
- Request To Borrow A Book
Browse Collection and click on the flower (book / flower - same difference!) that interests you. It will show you the places where owners have offered to lend it. You can send a request message to the owner to borrow.

If Meulib is not in your city yet, you can start it! You have the power! Which brings us to the next thing -

- Add Books That You Are Willing To Lend
Go to My Books (it comes up after you login) and add books that you are willing to lend. Show your collection to the world! (Specially your neighbors, family, friends, office colleagues who can borrow from you). Expand your book garden.

Meulib, Meulib oh my tulip
How does your garden grow?
With many many many books
With million billion zillion books
And sharing fairies all in a row.

If you have any questions or suggestions on how to make Meulib more beautiful please write to support or to email me (simply reply to this email). The How It Works and Frequently Asked Question pages may also help.

Have a very nice day
